you may need the ants Command Line Parser utilities and itk to use this.
	antsCommandLineOption.cxx
	antsCommandLineOption.h
	antsCommandLineParser.cxx
	antsCommandLineParser.h
you can link the above files from ants to the sccan source directory and compile with cmake, linking to itk, which we assume is compiled and available elsewhere.
