	We studied our subjects with an in-depth neuropsychological assessment

	reading and false font string observations (baseline condition).
	The neuropsychological assessment revealed that familial dyslexia,
	in both persistent and compensated forms, is often associated with
	deficits in verbal short-term memory, phonological awareness and
	automatization abilities. The functional results showed a lack of
	activation in the posterior areas of the reading network. This study,

	Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used multivariate analytic
	techniques to investigate memory-related functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) activity in 52 individuals across the continuum of
	normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD. Independent
	component analyses revealed specific memory-related networks that
	activated or deactivated during an associative memory paradigm. Across
	all subjects, hippocampal activation and parietal deactivation demonstrated
	a strong reciprocal relationship. Furthermore, we found evidence
	of a nonlinear trajectory of fMRI activation across the continuum
	of impairment. Less impaired MCI subjects showed paradoxical hyperactivation
	in the hippocampus compared with controls, whereas more impaired
	MCI subjects demonstrated significant hypoactivation, similar to
	the levels observed in the mild AD subjects. We found a remarkably
	parallel curve in the pattern of memory-related deactivation in medial
	and lateral parietal regions with greater deactivation in less-impaired
	MCI and loss of deactivation in more impaired MCI and mild AD subjects.
	Interestingly, the failure of deactivation in these regions was also
	associated with increased positive activity in a neocortical attentional
	network in MCI and AD. Our findings suggest that loss of functional
	integrity of the hippocampal-based memory systems is directly related
	to alterations of neural activity in parietal regions seen over the
	course of MCI and AD. These data may also provide functional evidence
	of the interaction between neocortical and medial temporal lobe pathology
	in early AD.},

	During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, young and

	matching, attentional cueing, and working memory. Accuracy of performance
	was roughly matched at 80\% across tasks and groups. Modulations
	of activity across conditions were assessed, as well as functional
	connectivity of both networks. Younger adults showed a broader engagement
	of the DMN and older adults a more extensive engagement of the TPN.
	Functional connectivity in the DMN was reduced in older adults, whereas
	the main pattern of TPN connectivity was equivalent in the 2 groups.
	Age-specific connectivity also was seen in TPN regions. Increased
	activity in TPN areas predicted worse accuracy on the tasks, but
	greater expression of a connectivity pattern associated with a right
	dorsolateral prefrontal TPN region, seen only in older adults, predicted
	better performance. These results provide further evidence for age-related
	differences in the DMN and new evidence of age differences in the
	TPN. Increased use of the TPN may reflect greater demand on cognitive
	control processes in older individuals that may be partially offset
	by alterations in prefrontal functional connectivity.},

	WM contains fiber pathways that convey axons linking cerebral cortical
	areas with each other and with subcortical structures, facilitating
	the distributed neural circuits that subserve sensorimotor function,
	intellect, and emotion. Recent neuroanatomical investigations reveal
	that these neural circuits are topographically linked by five groupings
	of fiber tracts emanating from every neocortical area: (1) cortico-cortical
	association fibers; (2) corticostriatal fibers; (3) commissural fibers;
	and cortico-subcortical pathways to (4) thalamus and (5) pontocerebellar
	system, brain stem, and/or spinal cord. Lesions of association fibers
	prevent communication between cortical areas engaged in different
	domains of behavior. Lesions of subcortical structures or projection/striatal
	fibers disrupt the contribution of subcortical nodes to behavior.
	Disconnection syndromes thus result from lesions of the cerebral
	cortex, subcortical structures, and WM tracts that link the nodes
	that make up the distributed circuits. The nature and the severity
	of the clinical manifestations of WM lesions are determined, in large
	part, by the location of the pathology: discrete neurological and
	neuropsychiatric symptoms result from focal WM lesions, whereas cognitive
	impairment across multiple domains--WM dementia--occurs in the setting
	of diffuse WM disease. We present a detailed review of the conditions
	affecting WM that produce these neurobehavioral syndromes, and consider
	the pathophysiology, clinical effects, and broad significance of
	the effects of aging and vascular compromise on cerebral WM, in an
	attempt to help further the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment
